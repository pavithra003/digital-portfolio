    <p>A great teacher always has compassion for their students, understanding of their students' personal lives, and appreciation for their academic goals and achievements. Teachers are role models for children to be positive, always try harder, and reach for the stars.</p>
    <h4>canteen</h4>

    <p>The canteen in a college is not only about food and socializing, but it also plays a role in promoting healthy eating habits among students. Many college canteens aim to provide nutritious meals and snacks that promote the overall well-being of students.

    <h4>smart classes</h4>

    <p>This makes learning engaging and easy to understand. The use of smart boards allows the teacher to deliver lectures more efficiently with various projections for illustrations. With visual presentations, they can easily demonstrate every lesson's crucial aspect.</p>
    <h4>play grounds</h4>

    <p>uch of this would be impossible without specialised sports facilities for the best competitors. However, these facilities benefit a select few over the majority. Funding for such facilities is a limited part of a federal budget that must cover essential areas like health, education, and the military.</p>
